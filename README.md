# Pebble

    (  !! As of this writing this readme reflects pebble version 1.0.106 !! )

Pebble is a social incremental game in which you gain pebbles from a main world pebble 'reserve' account. 

   * There are a fixed number of pebbles in the world.
   * every time a new player signs up for a pebble account they increase the world population.
   * an equal share of the worlds pebbles is the total number of pebbles in the world divided by the number of players.

## Getting started

To get started set up your pebble account by registering on the sign-up page. Once You create your account and log in you can start gaining pebbles, by going to the reserve tab, and clicking "take a pebble" button. This allows you to take pebbles directly from the reserve account at the rate of one pebble per click. Each time you take a pebble from

## Home Tab

as of this writing there is not much to do on the home tab for 1.0.x

## Reserve Tab

The reserve tab is where to go to get an idea as to what is going on with the reserve account. It is also the place to go to check anything, or do anything that has to do with the pebble world government.

### The reserve info:

the reserve info section displays important information about the reserve account.

The reserve info section displays:
    * shows the total amount of pebbles in the world.
    * shows how many pebbles are in the reserve account.
    * shows the total number of players (population)
    * shows what an equal share of the world total of pebbles is.
    
### The take a pebble button.

The take a pebble button is how to go about getting things started (assuming there are pebbles to take in the reserve). To get started just keep clicking that thing like crazy and the requesting count will grow. Every few seconds it should reset to zero, and your wallet should increase by the amount of times you clicked the button. 

If you don't get anything check out the reserve info section to see if there are any pebbles in the reserve, if it is empty then that means that there are to many people playing, or someone has gotten greedy. Don't worry though they will be taxed, check again in a few.
