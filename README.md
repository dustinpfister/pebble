# Pebble

Pebble is a social incremental game in which you gain pebbles from a main world pebble 'reserve' account. 

   * There are a fixed number of pebbles in the world.
   * every time a new player signs up for a pebble account they increase the world population.
   * an equal share of the worlds pebbles is the total number of pebbles in the world divided by the number of players.
   * you pay tax back to the reserve based on how many pebbles you have in relation to an equal share of the worlds pebbles.
