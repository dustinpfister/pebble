## Getting started

To get started set up your pebble account by registering on the sign-up page. Once You create your account and log in you will have some starting pebbles. You can start manually gaining pebbles from the reserve by going to the reserve tab and clicking the 'take a pebble' button which allows you to directly take pebbles from the reserve account one at a time.
