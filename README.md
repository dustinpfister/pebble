# Pebble

    please note: As of this writing this readme reflects pebble version 1.0.434

Pebble was originally an idea for what I would call a "social incremental game" centered around the idea of an in game 
finite currency supply called "pebble". As of this writing I have abandon the original idea of a single stand alone game, 
and have instead started recognizing pebble as more of a platform from which one or more stand alone games (or maybe 
even gaming platforms) may be developed as separate independent forks.

## Status of project

Considering that I have spent a great deal of time working on this project all ready, it is likely that I will continue 
supporting it. There is much work to be done, but the basic idea appears to be in place. I will also continue trying to find 
what exactly "pebble is" with respect to it's future as a platform. I intend to try my luck with my first separate fork of 
pebble that will be the first game based off of pebble. This readme will likely be updated in the near future as I will likely flip back and forth between working on that game, and further improving this platform that it is based on.
