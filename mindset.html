    <h1>A Mindset:</h1>

    <ul>
        
        <li>
            
            <h2>1) Be emotionally stable.</h2> 
            
            <p>
            You must be happy, and not depressed. You must not allow your emotions to get in the way of your success, let alone allow them to interfere with your ability to function all together. Find a way to relieve stress, anxiety, and hopelessness in face of the harsh unforgiving reality that is the human situation. Many people believe in God to achieve this. Don't believe in God? Then find a coping mechanism that works, as this is first and foremost.
            </p>
            
        </li>
        
        <li>
            
            <h2>2) Understand the emotional impact other people have on you. </h2>
            
            <p>I have found that other people have a profound impact on my emotional health, but sadly so far it seems that impact has been almost exclusively neutral, and negative. There are a lot of reasons why this is such as poverty, reasons why there is poverty, reasons why poverty keeps growing, the lack of an absolute objective meaning to life, the list goes on. Still negative people are going to drag you down, while positive people are going to have a positive impact. Their awesomeness will rub off onto you.</p>
            
        </li>
        
        <li>
            
            <h2>3) Be the best at what you do.</h2>
            
            <p>As of this writing there are 7.4 billion people in the world, with a birth rate that exceeds the death rate by 90 million a year. Even if you are a one in a million kind of person there are still 7,400 people just like you, and 90 more on the way. Many of these people may be willing to do what you do for much less. This is the hard cold reality that you face, so it is not good enough to just be good at something, you must be the absolute best (or at least close to it).
            </p>
            
        </li>
        
        <li>
            
            <h2>4) Invest in Yourself</h2>
            
            <p>Always improve yourself, and this does not always mean going to college like everyone tells you that you have to or else you will die homeless and alone. If you can not get accepted to a good school, get your hands on the money you need to go, what have you, do not let that get in the way of you improving yourself. Read books, make friends with smart people, sell your TV (some 90% of the content on TV will only make you dummer).
            </p>
            
        </li>
        
        <li>
            
            <h2>5) Don't Go At It Alone</h2>
            
            <p>You need friends, but not just anyone will do, you need good friends. Good friends are sadly like gold, they are very rare, and almost impossible to just find on the street, or just any old place. Isolation can be nice for a while, but in time it can turn into a kind of living hell. So do whatever you can to make at least one good top-notch friend, and of course the more you can find the better.
            </p>
                
        </li>
         
        <li>
            
            <h2>6) Develop Great Oratory Skills </h2>
            
            <p>You need friends, and in order to get friends you must talk to people you want to talk to. Many people who are very successful are just very good at one very important skill, which is communication skill.</p>
            
        </li>
        
        <li>
            
            <h2>7) Take No Days Off. </h2>
            
            <p>This does not mean work your ass off constantly, on the contrary free time is essential to personal growth. However it does mean that you should always be working to achieve your goals, and never take a day off from pursuing them. Even if you succeed at your goals, you should always be thinking in terms of what the next step is when it comes to maintaning, and growing that success.</p>
            
        </li>
        
        <li>
            
            <h2>9) Take Risks</h2>
            
            <p>You will never get anywhere if you don't.</p>
            
        </li>
    
        <li>
            
            <h2>10) Keep trying</h2> 
            
            <p>Yes you will fail, and yes you will fail allot. You may fail a few times, you may fail countless times, but you never stop. You will never be of note worthy value to yourself, or others if you don't keep trying.</p>
            
        </li>
        
        <li>
            
            <h2>11) The goal is power, not money, not material possessions</h2> 
            
            <p>Big toys do not make you happy, power makes you happy. Money typically comes with power, and with that big toys ( that is if you would like some ). However this was never the motivation to gain power, it is only a byproduct of it. Power is what drives you, and what drives you is a desire to be happy.</p>
            
        </li>

        <li>
            
            <h2>12) Understand The Power Of "Leverage"</h2>
            
            <p>Do not work for other people, have other people work for you. Hopefully they do so because they want to, hopefully you can pay them well for the help. When you are on the receiving end of leverage, you are often victimized as a result of it. If you find yourself working for someone who inherited a multi billion dollar business from their dead parents, and never worked a day in there life, it is time to find a new job. If you must work for someone else, only work for someone who has empathy for your plight, someone who was where you where one day in their past. In other words, if you are going to work for a billionaire, only work for the kind of billionaire you would be.</p>
