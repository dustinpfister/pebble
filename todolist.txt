    shops :
    
    shop ownership:

       * updater.js files should be registered in the coreFiles foreach in checkPluginConf.

   main updater.js:
   
       * main updater.js should run updater.js files for each plugin that has one.

pebble_procesor:

   * make a seperate process from the main server.js file called pebble_processor.js
   * The process should process TransactionRequests.
   * every now and then the process should stop processing TransactionRequests to preform other tasks on the current state of accounts.
   * In addition to processing transactions pebble process should also preform a sanity check every now and then, and logg the outcome 
   of that check to the reserve object.
   * In the event of a failed sanity check, pebble_process should take autocorrection action, when it happens this also should be logged to the reserve account.

pebble.js:

    * have a collection called TransactionRequest, all transactions should start out as this, then be processed.
    * once you have the TransactionRequest collection make a seperate process that actually preforms the transactions (call it pebble_processor)

users.js:

    * add a pluginData property.
    * allot of stuff in the userRec should be optional stuff that will be in pluginData.
    

pebble_check.js:

    * I am only checking prime user accounts, I should be checking ALL accounts.
    
pebble_fix.js:

    * I am only checking prime user accounts when preforming a check, I should be checking ALL accounts.
