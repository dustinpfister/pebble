Pebble todo list:


pebblebar:
   
   * update plugins and client system to work with new clientData Array.
   * a config file of sorts for pebblebar might be nice.
   * updater.js should be a process and not just something that is called from server.js
   * shops plugin :
   
       * should be able to define more then one shop class

pebble_procesor:

   * make a seperate process from the main server.js file called pebble_processor.js
   * The process should process TransactionRequests.
   * every now and then the process should stop processing TransactionRequests to preform other tasks on the current state of accounts.
   * In addition to processing transactions pebble process should also preform a sanity check every now and then, and logg the outcome 
   of that check to the reserve object.
   * In the event of a failed sanity check, pebble_process should take autocorrection action, when it happens this also should be logged to the reserve account.

pebble.js:

    * have a collection called TransactionRequest, all transactions should start out as this, then be processed.
    * once you have the TransactionRequest collection make a seperate process that actually preforms the transactions (call it pebble_processor)

users.js:

    * pull everything that has to do with shops into it's own file.

pebble_check.js:

    * I am only checking prime user accounts, I should be checking ALL accounts.
    
pebble_fix.js:

    * I am only checking prime user accounts when preforming a check, I should be checking ALL accounts.
